## What are waves?

At the most general level, waves are essentially repeating patterns of some physical quantity in space and/or time. These physical quantities could be for example pressure (i.e., sound waves), ocean surface height, electric field intensity, and many others. Below is an example plot showing a *cosine* wave, with either distance or time on the x axis and the height or intensity of the wave on the y axis.

![simple_wave]({{ "/assets/simple_wave.png" | absolute_url }})

We can see that this curve repeats itself roughly every \\(2\pi\\) distance or time units. If we then call the wave height \\(u\\) and now specify that the x-axis is time \\(t\\), the cosine wave is therefore defined:

$$ u(t) = \cos(t)$$.
